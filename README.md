*Deepfake Detection Model: Implements a deepfake detection system using a pre-trained InceptionResnetV1 model fine-tuned for this task.  Leverages transfer learning for improved accuracy.

*MTCNN Face Detection: Employs MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for robust face detection within input images. Handles cases where no faces are detected gracefully.

8*GradCAM Explainability: Integrates GradCAM (Gradient-based Class Activation Maps) to provide visual explanations for the model's predictions. Highlights the image regions that most influence the real/fake classification.  This helps understand why the model makes a certain decision.

*Gradio Interface: Creates an interactive web interface using Gradio, making the model easily accessible for testing and demonstration. Users can upload images and receive both predictions and visual explanations.

*Preprocessing: Includes image preprocessing steps like resizing and normalization to ensure compatibility with the model's input requirements.

*Prediction Output:  Returns prediction confidence scores for both "real" and "fake" classes, giving a measure of certainty.

*Visualization: Overlays the GradCAM heatmap onto the original face image, creating a clear visualization of the important regions for classification.

*Dependencies: Specifies all required libraries (e.g., torch, facenet-pytorch, pytorch-grad-cam, gradio) for easy environment setup.  A requirements.txt file would be a great addition for a real project.

*Model Loading:  Loads a pre-trained model checkpoint (resnetinceptionv1_epoch_32.pth).  In a real project, you would likely include the model file or instructions on how to obtain it.

*Device Handling: Uses CUDA (if available) for faster processing, and falls back to CPU if CUDA is not detected.
